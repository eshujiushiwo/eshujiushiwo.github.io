# Plan Your Deployment

Tapdata is designed with light weight and low up front cost in mind. You may choose an appropriate configuration based on your needs. 


## Hardware Requirements

Tapdata can be installed on physical servers, virtual machine or docker. 

Recommended Spec:

- CPU Cores: 8+
- RAM: 16GB+
- Storage: MongoDB Nodes only. SSD or high performance disk, 50GB+ 

 
## Minimum Configuration - Not for Mission Critical Use Cases

This is suitable for development, testing or non-critical produciton use cases that can afford prolonged downtime as this is a non-HA setup. 

- Tapdata Server:  1x
- MongoDB Servers: 1x



## Standard Configuration 

- Tapdata Server:  2x
- MongoDB Servers: 3x


## When to scale out your Tapdata Cluster

As a very rough guide, each Tapdata server with 8c can handle:

- 16 concurrent data pipelines, assuming each pipeline processes up to 1000 events per second, with each event is less than 1KB, or
- 100 concurrent API requests per second

When the number of data pipelines or API requests get bigger and bigger. We can perform horizontal scaling by simply adding more Tapdata nodes.
